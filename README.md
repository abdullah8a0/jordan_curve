# jordan_curve
Evaluating a function on a manifold [WIP]

Takes a Jordan curve S and evaluates a function f: SxS -> R^2 such that f(a,b) = f(b,a). The Range of this function, intersected with S, is then pojected onto a Mobius Band for analysis.

Checklist:

[x] Implement an easy way to input Jordan curves

[x] Make the code function independent

[] implement mobius_plot()
